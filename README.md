## Collaboration between CETAF and DiSSCo

**CETAF** (Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities) and **DiSSCo** (Distributed System of Scientific Collections) are collaborating to bring together their expertise in managing biodiversity data. TETTRIs Marketplace is a core component of this collaboration, aimed at fostering the exchange of biodiversity data across institutions and creating a shared technical infrastructure for the scientific community.

This project will allow researchers and data managers to easily access, share, and collaborate on biodiversity data, while adhering to best practices for data interoperability and long-term sustainability.
